Weekly meeting
--------------

Regular general weekly meeting is every Monday 8 PM PST. Meeting is open to really
everyone. Remote participation is possible using Google Hangout [through permanently opened video session](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/calendar/YmVya2VsZXkuZWR1X2UyYTVhcWc4cXJnaWM2bnQ2ZDk0OG0yNXJnQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20.kijreb7bhpl8qfkr7n9d549so4). Additionally, join us on our IRC
channel at that time for more information. We are also using our IRC channel for a backchannel
to the meeting. Notes are taken and sent to the mailing lists, and their address follow the
following format `http://pad.peerlibrary.org/p/meeting-YYYY-MM-DD`.
